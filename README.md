Project 2: Read Me
The required functionality for Step 6 was to display screenshots with the Grazioso Salvare logo on each screen. I encountered errors within my code, so I was not able to see any screenshots. Mongo was used as the Model component because we were connecting the animal Mongo files to the Jupyter Notebook code. The username and password that was used in the Mongo files for Project 1 were the same username and password that were used in Project 2 with Jupyter Notebook. The Dash framework provided a dashboard to be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook code. The steps that I have taken to do this project was first reading all the directions the whole way through. After that I pulled up my virtual module as well as the supporting materials reading. From there, I followed the directions to the best of my ability, instruction by instruction. As I have stated earlier, I have encountered challenges when it came to connecting the code. I was not sure on a step, but with hard work and leaning on my past assignments, I was able to get through it.  

CRUD Python (PY file) From Project 1
1)	Class MongoDBCRUD:   # Mongo class
def int(user, database_name, collection name):   # methods
user = MongoUser
user.database = user[aac_shelter_outcomes]
user.collection = user.database[animals]
def make_a_document 
if:   # if elsestatement
	result = user.collection.insert_one(papers)
	return true
else:
	return false

def read_papers(self, query):  #Read only
	if:  #if else statement
		cursor = user.collection.find(query)
		result = list(cursor)  #result
return result
	else:
		print(“Mistake, please try again: “)
		return 0
query = {
	“key”: “anilam values”
def update_papers(user, query, update_data):  #update papers
	if:  #if else statement
		update_list = [UpdateOne (query)
		result = user.collection.bulk_write(update_list)
		return result
	else: return 0 #return nothing
def delete_papers(user, query): #deleting documents
	if:  #if else statement
		result = user.collection.delete_many(query)
		return result.deleted_count
	else:
		return 0.

 One must write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by making sure that your code is neat, with program comments added to it. The advantage of connecting Project One Dashboard to the database in Project Two was not having to recode something that I have already coded before. I approach a problem as a computer Scientist as looking at the issue from a bird's eye view, then coming down and working to fix that problem piece by piece. With the database and dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested, I looked at the questions line by line, and instruction by instruction. I worked slowly to ensure that I gave every step to every problem, and all of me to the best of my ability. In the future I will make sure that I full understand the client's request, prior to completing the expected task ahead of me. Computer Scientists handles technology mix with life to make life easier and more efficcent for others. We matter because we innovate the world. My work will help a company like Grazioso Salvare because I would use my technical skills and knowledge as a Computer Scientist, and My excellent communication skills, to better add to the company.

 Thank you, Brianna Marsh.
